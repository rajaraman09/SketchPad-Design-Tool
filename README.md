# SketchPad-Design-Tool

The program layout should consist mainly of a 2D
drawing space along with the ability to select basic modes as follows:
- A mode to draw sketches using scribbled freehand lines
- A mode to draw straight lines
- A mode to draw rectangles
- A mode to draw ellipses
- A mode to draw special cases of these (squares and circles)
- A mode to draw polygons (open and closed polygons)
In addition, the user should be able to select a colour for any of the graphical objects that are about to
be drawn. Furthermore, the user should have a selection method so that they can identify an object
that has already been drawn and perform the following operations:
- Move the selected object to a new location
- Cut the object from the drawing (delete a graphical object)
- Paste the selected object (copy and paste) to a new location
Advanced versions of the program may also have the following functionality:
- Group the object with another object (possibly creating groups of arbitrary objects)
- Ungroup a set of objects that have been grouped
Very advanced versions of the program could contain the following additional functions:
- Undo (and Redo)
- Save (and Load) a partially completed drawing

This consist of following design artifacts:
- Statecharts for the designed interactive functions
- Object diagram representing the Software Architecture and any Design Patterns
- The source code and deployment specific files
